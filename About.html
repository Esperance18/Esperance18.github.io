<tr><td>We are a family school and have an open-door policy for parents to partner with us to support their child. Our laboratory-like classrooms are set up based on the Montessori educational philosophy and our program draws from the North American Montessori Centerâ€™s curriculum. We have a diverse and experienced team of dedicated teachers from around the world</td>
<td>Though the Grammar schools which were set up to deliver elementary education, they did require their entrants to already have certain skills. In particular, they expected them to be able to read and write in the vernacular. There was a need for something more basic</td>
<td>Schools exist within a strict legal framework,where they may be answerable to the church, the state through local authorities and their stakeholders. In England (but necessarily in other parts of the United Kingdom) there are six general types of state funded schools running in parallel to the private sector. The state takes an interest in safeguarding issues in all schools. All state-funded schools in England are legally required to have a website where they must publish details of their governance, finance, curriculum intent and staff and pupil protection policies to comply with ' The School Information (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2012 and 2016 </td>
